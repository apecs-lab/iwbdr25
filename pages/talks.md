Title: Embodied AI: From Robotic Reasoning and Manipulation to Multi‑Robot Collaboration

Abstract:
Robots that can understand natural language and coordinate physical actions are a key enabler for societies and human-centric automation. Yet mapping high-level, ambiguous human instructions to low-level, real-time robot control remains a core research challenge, especially under noisy perception and multi-robot coordination constraints. This talk examines how recent advances in large language models, multimodal perception, and deep multi-agent reinforcement learning can be combined to narrow this gap.

The first part of the talk presents a voice-controlled mobile manipulator that integrates a large language model for semantic parsing of spoken instructions with vision–language perception, visual navigation, and grasp planning to produce executable action sequences for object search, retrieval, and delivery. The second part studies collaborative object transportation with multiple robots via deep multi-agent reinforcement learning, emphasizing sensor-based policy learning and control synthesis for synchronized manipulation of shared payloads. Together, these projects highlight emerging research directions in language-grounded, perception-aware, and multi-robot control for assistive and service robotics.
