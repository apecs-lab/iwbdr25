Today’s modern applications are producing too large volumes of data to be stored, processed,
or transferred efficiently. Data reduction is becoming an indispensable technique in many
domains because it can offer a great capability to reduce the data size by one or even two
orders of magnitude, significantly saving the memory/storage space, mitigating the I/O burden,
reducing communication time, and improving the energy/power efficiency in various parallel
and distributed environments, such as high-performance computing (HPC), cloud computing,
edge computing, and Internet-of-Things (IoT). An HPC system, for instance, is expected to have
a computational capability of 1018 floating-point operations per second, and large-scale HPC
scientific applications may generate vast volumes of data (several orders of magnitude larger
than the available storage space) for post-anlaysis. Moreover, runtime memory footprint and
communication could be non-negligible bottlenecks of current HPC systems.

Tackling the big data reduction research requires expertise from computer science, mathemat-
ics, and application domains to study the problem holistically, and develop solutions and harden
software tools that can be used by production applications. Specifically, the big-data computing
community needs to understand a clear yet complex relationship between application design,
data analysis and reduction methods, programming models, system software, hardware, and
other elements of a next-generation large-scale computing infrastructure, especially given
constraints on applicability, fidelity, performance portability, and energy efficiency. New data
reduction techniques also need to be explored and developed continuously to suit emerging
applications and diverse use cases.

There are at least three significant research topics that the community is striving to answer:
(1) whether several orders of magnitude of data reduction is possible for extreme-scale sciences;
(2) understanding the trade-off between the performance and accuracy of data reduction; and (3)
solutions to effectively reduce data size while preserving the information inside the big datasets.
The goal of this workshop is to provide a focused venue for researchers in all aspects of data
reduction in all related communities to present their research results, exchange ideas, identify
new research directions, and foster new collaborations within the community.
